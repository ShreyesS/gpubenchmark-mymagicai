# gpubenchmark-mymagicai
As a Machine Learning intern at MyMagic AI, I was tasked with benchmarking different GPUs using various metrics and performance indicators to comprehensively evaluate their computational capabilities. 
For this project, I was given access to Ubuntu servers with NVIDIA drivers and RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 installed. Using open-source hugging face LLM models and the vLLM library, I was able to run experiments to test and compare the performance of both GPUs.
